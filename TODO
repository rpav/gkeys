## DONE

+ oneshot, pre/post hooks
  + make Hook a class
  X have EventManager handle per-profile hook settings so if it switches the hooks change
    .. not really useful, we might be inter-profile and hooks can check if they care
+ switch profiles toggle, e.g. game to default
+ repeat keys
  + delay + resend sufficient? => yes
  + configurable delays
+ auto-profile switching delayed until all keys up
+ watch files/dir and profile auto-reload on change
